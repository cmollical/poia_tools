Alpha/Beta Automation and Centralization Project

Executive Summary
Today, the Alpha/Beta testing process at athenahealth relies heavily on manual interventions from Client Recruitment and Product Operations (PrOps) teams. Tasks such as list generation, content creation, customer marketing/CSM coordination, and Salesforce synchronization are operationally intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, LaunchDarkly toggling, Jira task creation, and survey management are prone to human error due to their complexity. This proposal outlines an initiative to fully automate and centralize this process into a single platform where Product Owners can independently manage their Alpha/Beta testing. The goal is to significantly reduce operational overhead, streamline workflows, and accelerate feature testing and deployment cycles.

Business Value
•	Reduced Operational Overhead: By automating manual processes, PrOps and Client Recruitment can focus on higher-value strategic tasks such as deeper client engagement, proactive market research, and enhanced Feature roadmap planning.
•	Accelerated Testing Cycles: Product Owners gain direct control, enabling faster execution and iterations.
•	Improved Data Accuracy & Consistency: Centralized automation eliminates manual errors and ensures data integrity across platforms (Salesforce, Snowflake, LaunchDarkly, Jira).
•	Enhanced Visibility & Reporting: Automated survey management and built-in dashboards provide real-time feedback loops, enhancing decision-making.

Current Challenges
•	High manual workload in list processing, content creation, customer marketing coordination, and Salesforce updates.
•	Time-consuming manual creation and management of Jira Epics and Issues.
•	Inefficient management of client opt-in/opt-out processes and SFPI baseline tracking.
•	Complexity in handling client lists and various recruitment workflows, including randomization and filtering processes, which automation will address through standardized data handling, automated randomization methods, and integrated filtering capabilities.
Proposed Automated Workflow
1. List Generation & Curation (Completed):
•	Automated generation and curation of lists via an intuitive web UI.
•	Integration with existing data sources (Snowflake, dashboards).
2. Automated Content Creation (In development):
•	Auto-filled templates based on Feature/ Salesforce data for emails and recruitment messaging.
•	Integrated AI-driven content suggestions for messaging optimization.
3. Form & Survey Automation:
•	Automatic creation of Opt-in/ Opt-out form (migrate to Qualtrics).
•	Inclusion of SFPI questions in Opt-in/ Opt-out surveys to establish baseline satisfaction more consistently.
o	Note: we do no not currently have parity between clients surveyed for baseline/ alpha/beta and this will resolve that.
4. Jira Integration:
•	Automatic Epic creation upon Alpha/Beta initiation.
•	Auto-generation of Jira Issues for each wave (Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, Beta 2, etc.…).
•	Subtasks automatically populated for specific action steps (CSM approval, customer marketing coordination, etc.).
5. LaunchDarkly & Salesforce Integration:
•	Automated list uploads and synchronization to LaunchDarkly (if possible. If not, an exportable excel file).
•	Auto-sync participating clients to Salesforce Alpha/ Beta object directly from LaunchDarkly.
6. Opt-Out Management:
•	Self-service client opt-out mechanism (exploring Qualtrics), automatically updating LaunchDarkly, Salesforce and Reporting.
7. Post-Test Survey Automation:
•	Automatic triggering of satisfaction surveys via Qualtrics for Alpha/ Beta satisfaction (user input required to determine timing).
•	Integrated analytics for easy baseline versus post-test comparisons.

Project Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements Gathering
•	Document full requirements, refine workflows, and finalize integration logic.
Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure & API Development
•	Extend existing Node.js backend (server.js) with new automated endpoints.
•	Develop APIs for Jira, LaunchDarkly, Salesforce, and Qualtrics integration.
Phase 3: Frontend & UI Development
•	Expand existing UI to include new automation features and management dashboards.
•	User-friendly interfaces to support Product Owner self-service.
Phase 4: Integrations & Automation
•	Develop seamless automation scripts for Jira issue/Epic creation.
•	Establish continuous integration with LaunchDarkly, Salesforce, and Qualtrics.
Phase 5: QA & Testing
•	Comprehensive testing across the entire workflow and integrations.
•	Validate functionality and data accuracy.
•	Alpha/ Beta testing with PrOps.
Phase 6: Launch, Training & Documentation
•	Deploy solution to production environment.
•	Training sessions and documentation provided to Product Owners.

Timeline
•	Total Implementation Time: Approximately 5-6 months
•	Expected Launch: 25.11

Key Outcomes
•	Product Owners autonomously manage Alpha/Beta testing with minimal operational support.
•	Significant reduction in manual operational tasks for Product Operations.
•	Faster, error-free, and data-driven Alpha/Beta testing process.
